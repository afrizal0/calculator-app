# Calculator App
It's my first time to build a calculator app using **Javascript**, I build this around 2 days and it's suck a great to build my own calculator, hope I can improve my coding skill better than this.<br>

Here's my Calculator App look like : <br>

I learn to build this from this great article https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-an-html-calculator-app-from-scratch-using-javascript-4454b8714b98/
